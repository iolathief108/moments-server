common:
  - qn: Do you have packages?
    ans:
      - I do not offer specific packages where you are required to purchase certain items. I create a custom proposal for each client based on the types of flowers and arrangements that they are looking for.
  - qn: Do you have a minimum spend for weddings?
    ans:
      - I do not have a minimum. Everything is custom to each client's needs.
  - qn: How far in advance should we order our wedding flowers?
    ans:
      - It’s never too early to get in touch about your wedding, but we recommend having a few details figured out before you do. For example - Have you selected the location for your ceremony and/or reception? What’s your wedding style? Do you have a color scheme decided on? Most flowers will be based around a color scheme. Typically, our couples reach out around 6 to 12 months before their big day.
  - qn: Can I see a mockup of proposed flowers?
    ans:
      - Yes! After the contract is signed, we can provide a mock up for 50% of the proposal cost for the item being mocked up. We prefer to create this between 30 and 60 days before the wedding to take into account seasonal flowers and time to make adjustments before the final proposal and vendor commitments are due.
