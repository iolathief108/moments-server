    "I (Karin) remember how I felt planning my wedding. Things I had never thought about before suddenly became the most important things to me. I researched like crazy and made inspiration pages in my wedding binder (before the days of Pinterest) so I had a clear idea of what I wanted. Above all I knew I wanted the most BEAUTIFUL photos that represented us. And even though we did all this work to find a great photographer, we were so disappointed with our photos. Now, I realized what mistakes I made and what I wish somebody would have shared with me when I was choosing a photographer.",
    "I'm a film photographer based in Virginia, who travels the world capturing couples unique stories on film. I'm always ready to travel & continually inspired by my clients & the stunning locations I’m grateful to explore each year. When not working or traveling, you'll find me spending quality time with my husband & our rescued Australian shepherd mix named Bear. Obsessed with stonewashed linen, puppies & minimal design, my ideal evening is a relaxed alfresco dinner with friends at a farm table overflowing with wine bottles and lots of laughs.",

    "Creating timeless meaningful images. Welcome to a photographic journey through my lens. \"PHOTOGRAPHY IS AN ART OF OBSERVATION. IT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE THINGS YOU SEE AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE WAY YOU SEE THEM.",
    "I drink an absurd amount of tea and I make videos occasionally. I adore art museums and dabble on the ukulele. My entire life, I’ve loved sharing my perspective; illustrating life as I saw it and taking photos of things I thought may be overlooked. And I even wrote a journal entry at the age of 7 stating I would someday be an artist. In a black and white composition notebook, I poorly scribbled the words: “I don’t want to be famous, but I want people to want my art.”"

  "beautician": [
    "My curiosity for hair and makeup began when I was a little girl. Some of my fondest childhood memories were centered around chalky drugstore eyeshadows and fruit-flavored lip smackers. Now, I take inspiration from those times to create new ones with my daughter. I began to dedicate myself to this profession in 2006. 14 years later, my passion still burns just as strong and my philosophy still remains just as true. Never do too much, but just enough to give you that extra pop! Everyone is uniquely molded with different features and colors, so why hide it?

  "florist": [
    "I have a love for all things wild and natural, scented blossoms, mossy twigs, and starry nights. Flowers simply make my heart sing. I believe the magic of growing and gathering was planted in me years ago as a young girl, working alongside my mother picking wildflowers and lily of the valley. How I create is deeply rooted in who I am; a floral designer, grower, and potter. I feel my art background has been a really strong foundation for floral design as textures, color, and design are all intertwined with both arts.",
    "Hey there, Sarah here! I'm the owner and Lead Designer here at Mulberry & Moss. I started my floral career in retail 10 years ago and then transitioned into events. Since beginning my business in 2013, with the help of a growing team, we've designed and executed over 200 events from our Orange County studio. Outside of work, I'm an avid lover of iced lattes, romantic comedies, Netflix, Amazon Prime, cats, home decor shopping, and Happy Hour!"
